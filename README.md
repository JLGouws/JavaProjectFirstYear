This project uses the processing library as a front end. The processing library can be found at https://processing.org/ . Processing is writen entirely in Java, and uses Java's abstract windowing toolkit as a means of creating a graphical interface.

To find out how to run on Windows please look at the make file. The command is in a comment in the run function.

Warning the game sometimes glitches on startup. I think this is a problem with processing. If the game is either full-screen on startup or is blacked out, please restart the game...
